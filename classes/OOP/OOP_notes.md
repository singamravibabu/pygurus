# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Python

Welcome to an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python! OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure and organize code. It makes it easier to create and manage complex programs.

## What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a method of programming where you define classes that represent real-world objects and their behavior. Python, being a multi-paradigm language, supports OOP features such as classes and objects.

## Core Concepts of OOP

### Classes and Objects
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.
- **Object**: An instance of a class.

**Example**:
```python
class Car:
    pass

my_car = Car()  # my_car is an object of the Car class
```

### Attributes and Methods
- **Attributes**: Variables that store the state or data of an object.
- **Methods**: Functions defined within a class that describe the behavior of an object.
